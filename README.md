MMEAT = March Madness Excitement Alerting Tool

- scrapes FiveThirtyEight for Excitement Index and other game data
- sends a tweet via @MMEATool when the excitement index exceeds set threshold
- intended to engage casual/non- basketball viewers who might only want to watch the most interesting games and get some fodder for water cooler talk
